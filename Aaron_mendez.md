I learned quite a bit on how to manage this site on a base level and what it is used for.
I dont think i have any complaints that are not just with the site itself. Its just a little convoluted.
Thank you for taking the time to write down all of this information about github, so i could atleast understand it enough to write down a markdown for this assignment im doing.
